## Purpose
Nakesake is an effort to provide a framework for customizing JPA entity physical structure names
within Spring Boot applications.  The goal is to help provide more control over the physical naming
of database objects used in JPA.  This includes both aiding library providers that include JPA entities
as well as consumers of libraries that include JPA entities.
